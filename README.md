This project focuses on building a Medical Insurance Prediction Web Application using Machine Learning (ML) and Flask. 
The goal is to predict a person's medical insurance cost based on features like age, BMI, smoker status, and region. 
The ML model is deployed using Flask, and the application provides a user-friendly interface to input details and get predictions. 
Additionally, user authentication and database integration are implemented to store predictions in a MySQL database. 
The model is trained using a Gradient Boosting Regressor, achieving an RÂ² score of 0.8791, ensuring high accuracy. 
The Flask web application allows users to register, log in, input their details, and view their past predictions.
